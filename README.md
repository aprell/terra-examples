Terra Examples
==============

A repository of example [Terra](http://terralang.org) programs

- You can play around with the code in the Terra REPL: `terra -i file.t`
  evaluates the contents of `file.t` and enters the REPL.

- Every Terra function `f` can be pretty-printed with `f:printpretty()` and
  disassembled with `f:disas()`, which shows the function's LLVM IR and
  assembly.

- Tested with Terra [1.0.1](https://github.com/terralang/terra/releases/tag/release-1.0.1)
